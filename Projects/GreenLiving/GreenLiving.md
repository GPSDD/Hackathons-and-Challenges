# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are green living. A team of young developers trying all we could to fix one of some of the issues that poultry farmers are facing.
Poultry farmers are loosing their chicken due to some diseases and they are finding it difficult to diagnose what exactly went wrong.
An advisory system that can be used to give instructions on how to treat and prevent sick chicken from spreading the disease to other chicken is our solution. We care about the health of the chicken so that the poultry farmers can earn more by delivering healthy living chicken and eggs to their customers and grow more customers in fact.
We are using a mobile and web application, and an sms approach to help the poultry farmers quickly ask questions, post and image of the state of the sick chicken and get a quick response back with a solution.
Unlike other solutions, we do provide a video in our local language(KRIO) to help poultry farmers who may more read to understand exactly how to treat and prevent their sick chicken and also link them to an expert who may also aid them a lot.
Making sure every poultry farmers use this app to save the lives of their chicken is our utmost vision.
